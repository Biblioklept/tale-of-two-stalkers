                            <h2> Overview </h2>
                        </a> This guide will instruct you on how to properly install Tale of Two S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, a total conversion mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly that merges the games of Fallout 3 and New Vegas together! All essential mods required for performance and stability will also be installed. <br> The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. It has meticulously-detailed instructions, with additional notes, explanations, and/or images for the more complex instructions. It is incredibly important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them. There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide, it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.

                            <h2> Additional Mods </h2>
                        </a> If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until <b>after</b> you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on Discord should you need it. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide. If you do plan on adding mods after you finish the guide, please reference <a href="https://vivanewvegas.github.io/avoid-mods.html" target="_blank">this</a> list of mods that you should avoid using. I can not stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution or use automated tools and expect your game to function as intended! A reminder that I will <u>not</u> support setups that have added any mods.

                            </a> The guide will make the game run better than vanilla. The game is much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive, and it actually handles modern hardware pretty well. Installing the game on an SSD will drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering. Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS at 1080p: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>CPU:</b> Any dual-core processor (2.5GHz or more).</li>
                            <li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB of RAM.</li>
                            <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 600 series card or an AMD 5500 series card.</li>
